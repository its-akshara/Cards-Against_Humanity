How to Run Our Code:

Requirements: Android Studio, 2-3 Android Phones with at least API 23 (Can play
with 2 phones, but there’s no point to the game if you don’t have at least 3)

Setup:
- Install Android Studio
- Install Google Play Services SDK
    - https://developers.google.com/android/guides/setup
- Clone/Download the Android Studio project from Github
    - https://github.com/its-akshara/Cards-Against_Humanity
- Connect your phone(s) to your laptop(s), make sure USB debugging is enabled on
all of them and for best results, connect them all to the same Wifi

Building/Running the App:
- File->Open the project in Android Studio, selecting the
cardsagainsthumanityfrontend folder.
- Run the project on each of your phones:
    - NOTE: You must allow the app to access your location for the API to work
- Make sure that each phone is a different player, we strongly recommends
playing with only 3 players, because the connections aren’t reliable with any
more than 3.
