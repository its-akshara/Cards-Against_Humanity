# Cards-Against_Humanity
Cards Against Humanity now has an Android app! Made for CS M117.

# Workflow
Use branches when working on frontend! Periodically pull.
Never run git add . on a Mac, because you may accidentally add .D_STORE files
Also, only commit files you change. Recommitting the entire project can lead to merge conflicts so don't do it.
